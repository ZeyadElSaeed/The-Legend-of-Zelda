The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

The main aim of this project is to test our skills in using Unity to create a fully
functioning game as a part of a gaming studio. This project was done in a group of 8 students.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an open-world action-adventure game.
Players are tasked with exploring the kingdom of Hyrule while controlling Link. Link
is an agile explorer, a master fighter, and a capable rune user. Throughout his journey,
Link utilizes these skills to reach his destination. Link can use his navigation abilities to
freely explore a large mass of land. He can also fight enemies both in close quarters and
in ranged battles. Additionally, with the help of rune abilities, can manipulate objects
in the environment to solve puzzles and circumvent obstacles. Finally, Link must fight
powerful foes and exploit their weaknesses to defeat them.

The team has implemented Remote Bomb, Cryonis and Stasis as Link's rune abilities. In addition to Fireblight Ganon and Hinox as the bosses in the game.
